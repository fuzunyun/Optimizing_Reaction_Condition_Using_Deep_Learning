# Optimizing_Reaction_Condition_Using_Deep_Learning
This Code will allow you to reproduce the results published by the author on your local machine. Follow the instructions below, or consult our paper for more information. Don't hesitate to reach out via live chat or email if you have any questions.

# Instructions

## The computational environment 

The environment cannot be downloaded at this time and you will need to rebuild the environment locally with the following packages. 

* [sklearn(0.19.0)](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn.git)
* [keras(2.1.5)](https://keras.io/)
* [tensorflow(1.9.0)](https://www.tensorflow.org/)

## Running the code to reproduce the results

We have provided the best model and pre-processed data, all prediction results can be directly obtained by calling the model we saved.
